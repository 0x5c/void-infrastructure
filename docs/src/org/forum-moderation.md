# Forum Moderation

The forum is a managed communications space running at
`https://forum.voidlinux.org`.  The senior team rarely frequents the
forum, and so we delegate the powers of moderation to selected members
of the forum.

Things we generally expect forum moderators to do:

  * Keep the peace on the forums
  * Keep the spam down

Things to keep an eye out for:

  * Links to random user repositories (which are not allowed), with
    the exception of repositories that are testing things scheduled to
    be merged to master
  * Spam of any kind
  * Uncivil discourse

We expect moderators to exercise good judgement when determining what
needs action from a moderator, and in cases of question to consult
senior members of the team.
