# Organization

Void Linux is a controlled anarchy.  This is working as intended, and
we like it this way.  We've decided that it's better to have flexible
workflows that can adapt to new situations as they arise rather than
needing to consult detailed documentation or request authorization in
advance.

Rather than determining processes for every action, we instead choose
to trust our members to think on their feet and come up with
reasonable solutions.

We still need some processes though, and we need consistency in the
way that people think about problems.  The processes described in this
section aim to keep the organization running.
