# Void Infrastructure

Void is an Open Source project, and we make every effort to make our
process open as well.  This repo contains the Infrastructure as Code
(IaC) resources needed to provision and maintain Void's fleet of
servers.

The repo is carved up based on the technology in use in each section,
additional information can be found at the
[InfraDocs](https://infradocs.voidlinux.org) site.
